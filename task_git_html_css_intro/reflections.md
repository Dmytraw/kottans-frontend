## Tables
- `caption`

    Tag `caption` might be used to add a heading to a table. To adjust position of a caption css `caption-side` rule might be used.

- an attribute `colspan` helps to merge two or more table columns in one. We can perform alike operation on rows with `rowspan`. `border-collapse` css rule helps to change behaviour of the styling if borders are collapsed.

- aligning content inside table cell across Y-axis could happen with `vertical-align` rule and across X-axis with `text-align` rule.
